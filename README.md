# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
PyBer is a Python based ride-sharing app company. I have created a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, and urban. At the end, I have created a multiple-line graph to show the the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
There is a constant use of PyBear through out the first half of the year. There is obviously more users in urban areas than suburban and rural areas. There is also enough drivers for all the rides. However, there are many drivers in urban areas, that most of them had given a ride. Also, even though PyBer gets more fares from the urban population, we can see that urban drivers also don't get paid as well as the suburban and rural drivers. We also can see that the higher the population in the city, the lower the fare per ride and per driver.

## Summary
- Although we get more than half of our fares from the urban area, it is best that we have less drivers in that area, because many of them never had a ride in the first half of the year and urban drivers are getting as paid as well as the other city types. We should make a plan so that urban get paid better becuase they are the least paid compared to the other city type drivers. We should also consider removing the drivers that never gave a ride that time so that we can get a more accurate conclusion. 
- On the line graph, we can see that we can expect at least $500 and at most $1500 fares, from suburban areas. We can also expect at least $1,500 in fares from urban areas. 
- Beacause there are less drivers and more rides in rural and suburban cities, there average fare per ride is higher than average fare per driver.
